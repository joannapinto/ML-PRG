Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository includes Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms, covering classification, clustering, and regression techniques. It demonstrates theoretical concepts with practical examples, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.

Implemented Algorithms

1. FIND-S Algorithm
•	Implements the FIND-S algorithm on a training dataset to derive the most specific hypothesis.

2. Candidate Elimination Algorithm
•	Identifies the version space of hypotheses consistent with given training examples.

3. Naïve Bayesian Classifier
•	Implements the Naïve Bayes algorithm to classify data from a .csv file.
•	Computes classifier accuracy using test datasets.

4. Neural Network Implementation
•	Implements a basic feedforward neural network, including: 

5. Clustering with EM and k-Means Algorithms
•	Applies the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and k-Means clustering algorithms to a .csv dataset.
•	Compares results and evaluates clustering quality.

6. k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)
•	Implements k-NN for classification, using the Iris dataset as an example.

7. Locally Weighted Regression
•	Demonstrates non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression to fit data points.
•	Includes visualizations to compare actual and fitted data points.
